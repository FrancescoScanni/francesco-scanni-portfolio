<h1 align="center" id="title">Personal Portfolio - Francesco Scanni</h1>

<p id="description">It has been a while since I decided to challenge myself by building my personal portfolio website to showcase my skills projects and articles as a beginner in this specific environment. My goal is to create a clean and responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop. This project is a way for me to improve my front-end development skills while also experimenting with something new like the Tailwind and Bootstrap frameworks.</p>
